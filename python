""" Charlie set off with great zeal to the "Kracker Jack Fun Fair 2017". 



There were numerous activities at the fair, though Charlie, being a Math expert, liked to participate in the Addition Challenge.



The Challenge given to him was to find S, where

S=20 +21+22+...........+2N.



He would succeed in his challenge if he manages to tell the answer to the problem before others. He requests your help to solve the problem in a flash. 



Write a program using functions to find S and help Charlie win the challenge.



Function Specification

Use the function name as findSum(). The function must return S.

Input format :
The input contains an integer representing the value of N.

Output format :
The output prints the value of S."""



def findSum(int):
    s=0
    for i in range(0,n+1):
        s+=2**i
    return s
n=int(input())
print(findSum(n))
